The Problem
This is the first javascript program I wrote. I wanted to create the Matching Game for
my 6 year old daughter. I had learnt a little about javascript at uni before I wrote this code

My Solution
It took a long time. I understood the concept of what I wanted to achieve and worked through the logic step by step. Thank you to W3Schools which was a life saviour in terms of how to do something
